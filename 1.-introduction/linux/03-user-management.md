# 04 - User Management

## 4. User management <a id="3-user-management"></a>

`sudo`

List what rights the sudo user has.

```text
sudo -l
```

`sudo su` su means switch user

Sudo config file is usually **/etc/sudoers**

There are two commands to add a user in linux:`adduser`or `useradd` adduser is a perl-script that facilitate the process, and useradd is the native linux binary.

To add a user we do:

```text
adduser NameOfUser
useradd nameOfUser
```

To add user to sudo-group:

```text
adduser NameOfUser sudo
usermod -aG sudo NameOfUser
```

You might have to reboot for it to take effect.

On some machines we might not be able to edit the sudoers file because we don't have an interactive shell, in this case can you can just redirect the text into the file, like this:

```text
echo "username ALL=(ALL) ALL" >> /etc/sudoers
```

Check which users are in the sudo group:

```text
cat /etc/group | grep sudo
```

Switch user in terminal:

```text
su NameOfUser
```

Remove/delete user:

```text
sudo userdel NameOfUser
```

## 4. Permissions <a id="4-permissions"></a>

```text
ls -la
```

Shows all the files and directories and their permission settings.

```text
drwxrwxrwt 2 root root 4,0K ago  3 17:33 myfile
```

Here we have 10 letters in the beginning. The first one`d`shows that it is a directory.  
The next three letters are for read,`w`for write and`x`for execute. The first three belong to the owner, the second three to the group, and the last three to all users.
