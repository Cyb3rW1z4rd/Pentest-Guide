# Hashcat

hashcat accepts WPA/WPA2 hashes in hashcat's own “hccapx” file format. Use cap2hccapx to convert locally.

`hashcat -m 2500 –d 2 –force /root/hs/24Ghz.hccapx usr/share/wordlists/NETGEARXX999.txt`

: = do nothing

t = toggle case

T3 = toggle case 0,1,2,3 letter

$ = append character to end

## **Restore howto**

Consider that you used this command line to start a cracking job:

```text
hashcat -m 0 -a 3 --session session_name example0.hash masks/rockyou-7-2592000.hcmask
```

and you hit 'c' \(or 'q' for quit\) while it was running \(or it was stopped/killed for some other reasons\). This command resumes the above cracking job:

```text
hashcat --session session_name --restore
```

The second most important thing to note is that quitting hashcat via the **Checkpoint stop** feature,by hitting 'c', will wait until the restore file has updated to quit,

#### LEET SPEAK CRACKING

Leetspeak rule set enables Hashcat to replaces standard letters with a numeric or special character representation of that letter. With Leet Speak rule set, Hashcat interprets the phrase “password” located in the utilised wordlist as “p455w0rd”, “p@5sw0rd”, “passw0rd”, and many other combinations.

`hashcat -m 100 -a 0 -r /usr/share/hashcat/rules/leetspeak.rule /root/hash_dump.txt /root/Dictionaries/ -o cracked_hash.txt`

`-m 100` —specifies the hashing algorithm applied which was found utilising Hash-identifier tool.

`-a 0` —specifies the type of cracking, Straight in this case.

`-r` —informs that a rule set will be utilised in this cracking session.

`/usr/share/hashcat/rules/leetspeak.rule` —specifies the location of the rule set.

`/root/hash_dump.txt` —specifies the text file with the hashes.

`/root/Dictionaries/` —specifies the directory where wordlists reside. If the directory contains multiple wordlists, Hashcat will go through all of them progressively.

`-o` —enables output to file option.

`cracked_hash.txt` —specifies the location and the name of the file where cracked password will reside.

## Three most common and basic scenarios:

1.[Dictionary attack](https://hashcat.net/wiki/doku.php?id=dictionary_attack)

2.[Brute-Force attack](https://hashcat.net/wiki/doku.php?id=brute_force_attack)

3.[Rule-based attack](https://hashcat.net/wiki/doku.php?id=rule_based_attack)

### Dictionary attack – latest session = hashcat on RiaWifi

-Grab a wordlist, like [RockYou](http://downloads.skullsecurity.org/passwords/rockyou.txt.bz2).

-Put it into the hashcat folder.

-Rename your converted capture file “capture.hccapx”.

-On Windows, create a batch file “attack.bat”, open it with a text editor, and paste the following:

```text
hashcat -m 2500 /root/hs/capture.hccapx /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt
```

```text
hashcat –a 0 -m 2500 -d 2 --force --session session_name /root/hs/ANe0a60f.hccapx /usr/share/wordlists/holland.txt
```

`hashcat -O -a 0 -m 2500 -D 1,2 /Volumes/Samsung T5-1/LinuxTools/PeEs124.hccapx /Volumes/Samsung T5-1/LinuxTools/NETGEARXX000-999.txt`

Execute the attack using the batch file, which should be changed to suit your needs.

### Brute-Force Attack

* Rename your converted capture file “capture.hccapx”.
* Create a batch file “attack.bat”, open it with a text editor, and paste the following:

```text
hashcat -m 2500 –a 3 /root/hs/capture.hccapx ?d?d?d?d?d?d?d?d
```

`hashcat -a 3 -m 2500 -D 1,2 --session meinobf/Users/ehlaban/Downloads/LinuxTools/ANe0a60f.hccapx -1 ?l?u?d A?1?1?1?1?1?1?1`

This will pipe digits-only strings of length 8 to hashcat. Replace the ?d as needed.

It would be wise to first estimate the time it would take to process using a[calculator](https://hashcat.net/wiki/doku.php?id=combination_count_formula).

TBD: add some example timeframes for common masks / common speed

### Rule-based attack

This is similar to a Dictionary attack, but the commands look a bit different:

```text
hashcat –a 0 -m 2500 –r /usr/share/hashcat/rules/uppercase.rule –r /usr/share/wordlists/append0-1000.rule /root/hs/capture.hccapx /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt
```

`hashcat –a 0 -m 2500 -d 2 --force--session session_name-r /usr/share/hashcat/rules/uppercase.rule -r /usr/share/hashcat/rules/append0-1000.rule /root/hs/ANe0a60f.hccapx /usr/share/wordlists/holland.txt`

`hashcat –a 0 -m 2500 -r /Users/ehlaban/Downloads/LinuxTools/uppercase.rule -r /Users/ehlaban/Downloads/LinuxTools/append0-3000.rule /Users/ehlaban/Downloads/LinuxTools/AmigoWNet.hccapx /Users/ehlaban/Downloads/LinuxTools/klifrak.txt`

This will mutate the RockYou/holland wordlist with 2 rule files, which come with the hashcat distribution.

Change as necessary and remember, the time it will take the attack to finish will increase proportionally with the amount of rules.

**What are rules - What are rules?**
