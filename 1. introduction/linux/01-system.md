# 01 - System

## 1. System

To display information regarding the systems processes you can use the`ps`command.

```text
ps -aux
```

`-a`stands for all  
`-u`stands for all processes by all users  
`-x`stands for all processes that don't run a`tty`

`ps -fC leafpad`

`Kill <pid id>`



If you run this command you will probably see a pretty big output. In the column for **command** you will see what command has been run. Every process has a Process Identification Number \(**PID**\). Something you will also see in the output.

All of theses processes can actually be found in`/proc`. You just go to`/proc/[pid]`. In`/proc`you can find information about the system, and you can actually change the system if you change those files! But more on that later. What I wanted to explain is that if we look at the output from`ps`we see that some commands are in brackets. Like this:

```text
root        10  0.0  0.0      0     0 ?        S    ene14   0:00 [watchdog/0]
root        11  0.0  0.0      0     0 ?        S    ene14   0:00 [watchdog/1]
root        12  0.0  0.0      0     0 ?        S    ene14   0:00 [migration/1]
root        13  0.0  0.0      0     0 ?        S    ene14   0:00 [ksoftirqd/1]
```

Those are usually kernel processes, and you can safely assume that no user has started them.

If you want to monitor processes in real time you can use`top`or `htop` `top` comes preinstalled on most distros. But`htop`is really a lot nicer.

For`htop`the F1-10 keys might trigger OS-events. So you can use the shortcuts instead.

```text
Shortcut Key    Function Key    Description
h                    F1           Invoke htop Help
S                    F2           Htop Setup Menu
/                    F3           Search for a Process
I                    F4           Invert Sort Order
t                    F5           Tree View

>
                    F6           Sort by a column
[                    F7           Nice â€“ (change priority)
]                    F8           Nice + (change priority)
k                    F9           Kill a Process
q                    F10          Quit htop
```

## Packages

Something that difference Linux from windows is how it handles installing new software. In windows you usually have to google around and then click on random scary download buttons that might fuck up your computer, or not. It's like a constant lottery where you win by no installing malware. In Linux that is usually not really an issue. That is because distros have their own software repositories from where you can download your software. This is kind of like an app-store except everything is free.

The different major branches of teh GNU/Linux OS have their own software repositories. Ubuntu has their own, debian has their own, and so on.

Different distros also have their own package-amangers. For example, Debian and ubuntu uses`apt`, while Redhat uses`rpm`, and Arch uses`pacman`. You should strick to your own package-manager, because even though chaning package-manager is possible it will probably just cause you more headache than benefits.

### Install package <a id="install-package"></a>

Example of how to install something with apt:

```text
sudo apt-get install nmap
```

If you only have a .deb file you do this to install from the terminal:

```text
sudo dpkg -i /path/to/deb/file
```

```text
sudo apt-get install -f
```

### Remove packages <a id="remove-packages"></a>

This can be tricky. First find the package

```text
dpkg --list
```

Then you find it in your list.

```text
sudo apt-get --purge remove nameOfProgram
```

When you remove some package it might have requires some other dependencies. To remove those you run

```text
sudo apt-get autoremove
```



## Organizing your $path variable

I am talking about debian/ubuntu here. On other systems I don't know.

You can define your path in`/etc/environment`. If you don't have it you can create it and add the path like this:

```text
source /etc/environment && export PATH
```

If you are using zsh \(which you should\) you have to add it here

```text
sudo vim /etc/zsh/zshenv
```

And add this line somewhere:

```text
source /etc/environment
```

### Adding a path

This is a non-persistent way to add binaries to your path. Might be useful if you have entered a system that has limited binaries in the path.

```text
export PATH=/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin
```



### symbolic linking

Create a symbolic link so the program is in the path for starting it from everywhere.

`ln -s /opt/program/myprog /usr/bin/myprog`



### Installing custom packages 

If you download a package that is not in the official repository you can put the binary in`/opt`. That is good place to put your binaries.

Now you need to add that path to your path-variable. Remember how we set that in`/etc/environment`. So now open up that file and add`/opt`to it, so i looks like this.

```text
PATH="/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin:/usr/games:/usr/local/games:/opt"
```

I always add custom binaries last. That means that if we have two binaries with the same name the machine will first select the original binary. This way you won't have to fear screwing up, by accidentally creating a new`ls`binary for example.



## Cronjobs

There are two ways to configure cronjobs. The first one is by putting scripts in the following folders.

```text
/etc/cron.daily
/etc/cron.hourly
/etc/cron.weekly
/etc/cron.monthly
```

The second way is to write the command in the crontab

```text
# list cronjobs
crontab -l

# Edit or create new cronjobs
crontab -e
```



## Devices/disks/partitions <a id="8-devicesdiskspartitions"></a>

First some terminology. A`drive`is a physical storage device, just as a hard disk, solid state drive, or usb. In Linux these drives are represented as special file system objects called "device". They are found under`/dev`.A physical storage unit, a drive, can be divided up in to multiple logical storage units, these are called`partitions`. So they are just digital divisions of the drive. In linux a device are often named something like sda, sdb, sdc. And the partions of those devices are numbered. So one partion might be called`sda1`, and another`sda2`. These can then be found under`/dev/sda1`and`/dev/sda2`.

You can view the devices and their partions with the command`lsblk`

`df -lh` **to show disks free \(available\)**

### Formating disks <a id="formating-disks"></a>

If you want to do it the easy way, just open`gnome-disks`.

To format disks we are going to use the program`parted`. It can be used with its own shell or by running commands. So you can just run parted, and you will enter the parted interface. But here we are going to run the commands instead.

```text
# Make sure you know which device you are working with, they can change name between boots
lsblk
```

**Partition standard**

First we have to choose a partition standard. The modern and mostly used is gpt, and older is msdos.

```text
# This will destroy all the data on the on the disk
sudo parted /dev/sda mklabel gpt
```

**Create a new partition**

```text
sudo parted --align optimal /dev/sda mkpart primary ext4 0% 100%
```

This command creates a new partition \(mkpart\), which is of type primary, that takes up the space between 0-100%. Which means we will only have one partition.

Now you can see your new partition with`lsblk`.

**Format the partition with a specific filesystem**

Now that we have a partition we need to add a filesystem to it.There are many different types of filesystems. ext4 is common for linux. While windows uses NTFS, and mac uses HFS Plus. exFAT can be understood by all three OS:s, something that might be useful to USB:s.

```text
# For linux
sudo mkfs.ext4 /dev/sda1

# Supposedly work on linux, mac and windows. But fails for me on my tests on Mac 
sudo mkfs.vfat /dev/sda1

# To use UDF (universal disk format) that should also work on all OS
# You first need to install apt-get install udftools. Then you do:
mkudffs /dev/sda1
```

**Remove partition**

```text
# if you want to remove partition 1
sudo parted /dev/sda rm 1
```

**Mount it**

Now you can just mount the parition somewhere on your filesystem

```text
# Mount it
sudo mkdir /mnt/here
sudo mount /dev/sda1 /mnt/here

# Unmount it
sudo umount /mnt/here
```

List all devices

```text
lsblk
fdisk -l
```

### Encrypt a partition <a id="encrypt-a-partition"></a>

```text
sudo cryptsetup luksFormat /dev/sda1
```

**Mount an encrypted parition**

```text
cryptsetup open /dev/sda1 backup
```

Then you mount it:

```text
mount /dev/mapper/backup /media/username/back
```

### Change encryption passphrase <a id="change-encryption-passphrase"></a>

First find out which device is the encrypted device:

```text
lsblk
# In type you will see "crypt"
```

There are eight slots for passphrases. You can view these slots like this:

```text
sudo cryptsetup luksDump /dev/sda3
```

Add a key:

```text
sudo cryptsetup luksAddKey /dev/sda3
```

Remove a key:

```text
sudo cryptsetup luksRemoveKey /dev/sda3
# You are then prompted to input the key/passphrase you want to remove
```

### Formatting a USB <a id="formatting-a-usb"></a>

In order to format a usb drive we have to do the following.

If you have stored sensitive information, or otherwise want to make sure that it is not possible to read removed files from the USB you can overwrite the usb \(or any other kind of disk\) with zeroes, or just random data. So we can start by doing that, however, first we need to know the device name of the usb.

First find out the name of the usb/device. We can to that by looking at the`dmesg`or`tail -f var/log/syslog`when we insert the usb. Another way is to run the command`lsblk`before and after inserting the USB. In my case the usb was called`sda,`, but for you it might be something else. Make sure you know exactly which device you are working with, otherwise you will completely detroythe wrong device. Then we need to unmount the usb.

```text
sudo umount /dev/sda
```

Now we are ready to overwrite it with zeroes. It can be done like this:

```text
sudo dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/sda bs=1k count=2048 status=progress
```

Then we just write a new filesystem to the device:

```text
sudo mkfs.ext4 -L "NameOfVolume" /dev/sda
```

ext4 works well with linux, vfat and ntfs should work with windows.

```text
sudo mkfs.vfat -n "NameOfVolume" /dev/sda
```

### Create bootable USB

#### Difference between sbin and bin <a id="difference-between-sbin-and-bin"></a>

sbin is system binaries. A normal user do not have access to these binaries. It is only root and users with sudo privileges that do.

```text
pelle@mymachine:/bin$ ls -la /bin
total 4092
drwxr-xr-x  2 root root   4096 2012-02-04 19:12 .

-rwxr-xr-x  1 root root   8796 2007-11-15 13:01 hostname
```

We have echo, cp, grep. The normal stuff a user needs.

In sbin we have binaries that control the system.

### Mount

`df -lh` **to show disks free \(available\)**

So everything on the linux-filesystem belongs to some part of the filesystem-tree. So if we plug in some device we need to mount it to the filesystem. That pretty much means that we need to connect it to the filesystem. Mount is like another word for connect.

So if you want to connect a CD-rom or USB to your machine. You need to mount it to a specific path on the filesystem.

So if you plug in the usb it might be accessible at**/dev/usb**. But that it not enough for you to be able to browse the usb content. You need to mount it. You do this by writing

```text
mount /dev/usb /media/usb
```

Or whereever you want to mount it.

So when you click on Eject or Safetly remove you are just unmounting.

```text
umount /media/usb
```

Knowing how to mount and unmount might be useful if you want to get access to a remote NFS-directory. You will need to mount it to your filesystem to be able to browse it.

It is possible that the disk is not known as`/dev/usb`. If that is the case you can run

```text
sudo fdisk -l
```

And see if you can find your device, and look for the address. Then you mount it like this \(or with the correct path\)

```text
sudo mount /dev/sda1
```

#### Mount crypto-volume <a id="mount-crypto-volume"></a>

```text
cryptsetup open /dev/sda1 backup
```

Then you mount it:

```text
mount /dev/mapper/backup /media/username/back
```



### Create your of filesystem <a id="create-your-of-filesystem"></a>

In some cases it might be useful to create your own disk. Maybe for attaching to a virtual machine, or maybe to facilitate a backup. It is just a easy nice little container to have. It just requires two easy steps.

**Create a chunk in memory**

```text
truncate -s 100MB nameOfFile
```

**Attach a filesystem to file**

```text
mkfs.ext4 ./nameOfFile
```

**Mount it to your filesystem**

```text
sudo mount ./nameOfFile /mnt/blabla
```



## Controlling services

### Systemctl <a id="systemctl"></a>

Systemctl can be used to enable and disable various services on your linux machine.  
Start ssh

```text
systemctl start ssh
systemctl status ssh
systemctl stop ssh
```

You can verify that the service is listening for connection by running network status.

```text
netstat -apnt
```

Make ssh start upon boot

```text
systemctl enable ssh
systemctl enable apache2
```

### Init.d <a id="initd"></a>

Init.d is just a wrapper around Systemctl. I prefer it.

```text
/etc/init.d/cron status
/etc/init.d/cron start
/etc/init.d/cron stop
```

### rcconf <a id="rcconf"></a>

This is a tool to control services more easily, what is running upon boot and so on.



## Kernel <a id="11-kernel"></a>

The Kernel is responsible for talking between the hardware and the software, and to manage the systems resources.

The Linux Kernel is a monolithic kernel, unlike the OSX and the Windows kernels which are hybrid.

You can find the kernel file in`/boot`. It might look like something like this`vmlinuz-4.4.0-57-generic`. In the beginning of time the kernel was simply called`linux`. But when Virtual Memory was introduced they changed the name to`vmlinux`to reflect that the kernel could handle virtual memory. When the kernel later became too big it was compressed using zlib , therefore the name was changed to`vmlinuz`.

The Linux Kernel differs from Windows in that it contains drivers by default. So you don't have to go around looking for drivers like you do on windows when you want to install a printer, or something like that.

It is really easy to upgrade to the latest Linux kernel, all you have to do tis this:

```text
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get dist-upgrade
# or
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade
```

If you are using a distro that is Long Term Supported \(LTS\). You will not get the latest Kernel version, but you will get the latest Long Term Supported version.



## Logging <a id="14-logging"></a>

Logs can be viewed here on debian distros`/var/log/`
