# XSS

Cross site scripting is a vulnerability that lets an attacker control some of the content of a web application. Cross-Site Scripting \(XSS\) attacks are a type of injection, in which malicious scripts are injected into otherwise benign and trusted web sites.

> XSS vulnerabilities happen when a web application uses **unfiltered user input** to **build the output content** displayed to its end users. **XSS occurs when a web page displays user input** _\*\*_— typically via JavaScript— that isn’t properly validated.

Cross site scripting vulnerabilities can be **reflected**, **persistent** or **DOM based**.

[Microsoft](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft) security-engineers introduced the term "cross-site scripting" in January 2000. The expression "cross-site scripting" originally referred to the act of loading the attacked, third-party web application from an unrelated attack-site, in a manner that executes a fragment of [JavaScript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript) prepared by the attacker in the [security context](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Same-origin_policy) of the targeted domain \(taking advantage of a reflected or non-persistent XSS vulnerability\). The definition gradually expanded to encompass other modes of code injection, including persistent and non-JavaScript vectors.

**Cross-Site Scripting \(XSS\) attacks occur when:**

1. Data enters a Web application through an untrusted source, most frequently a web request.
2. The data is included in dynamic content that is sent to a web user without being validated for malicious content.

The malicious content sent to the web browser often takes the form of a segment of JavaScript, but may also include HTML, Flash, or any other type of code that the browser may execute. The variety of attacks based on XSS is almost limitless, but they commonly include transmitting private data, like cookies or other session information, to the attacker, redirecting the victim to web content controlled by the attacker, or performing other malicious operations on the user's machine under the guise of the vulnerable site.

## Testing

To test XSS, you van inject some valid HTML/JavaScript code like:

`<i>` or `<script>alert('XSS')</script>`

Enter this in input boxes or in the url like \[[http://target.com/page.php?something=&lt;script&gt;alert\('XSS'\)&lt;/script&gt\]\(http://target.com/page.php?something=](http://target.com/page.php?something=<script>alert%28'XSS'%29</script&gt]%28http://target.com/page.php?something=)alert%28'XSS'%29&lt;/script&gt;\);

Display the curent cookies: `<script>alert(document.cookie)</script>`
