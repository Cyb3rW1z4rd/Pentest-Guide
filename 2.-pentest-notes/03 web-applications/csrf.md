# CSRF

Cross-Site Request Forgery \(CSRF\) is an attack that forces an end user to execute unwanted actions on a web application in which they're currently authenticated. CSRF attacks specifically target state-changing requests, not theft of data, since the attacker has no way to see the response to the forged request. With a little help of social engineering \(such as sending a link via email or chat\), an attacker may trick the users of a web application into executing actions of the attacker's choosing. If the victim is a normal user, a successful CSRF attack can force the user to perform state changing requests like transferring funds, changing their email address, and so forth. If the victim is an administrative account, CSRF can compromise the entire web application.

## Spoofing vs. Hijacking

Before we go too far, you should know that spoofi ng and hijacking are two distinctly different acts.

Spoofi ng occurs when an attacking party pretends to be something or someone else, such as a user or computer. The attacker does not take over any session.

In hijacking, the attacker takes over an existing active session. In this process, the attacker waits for an authorized party to establish a connection to a resource or service and then takes over the session.
