# 445 - SMB/NETbios

**see also** [port 139](port-139-netbios.md)

Stands for "Server Message Block." **SMB** is a network protocol used by Windows-based computers that allows systems within the same network to share files. It allows computers connected to the same network or [domain](https://techterms.com/definition/domain) to access files from other local computers as easily as if they were on the computer's local hard drive.

Not only does SMB allow computers to share files, but it also enables computers to share printers and even serial ports from other computers within the network. For example, a computer connected to a Windows network could print a document on a printer connected to another computer on the network, as long as both machines support the SMB protocol.

Though SMB was originally developed for Windows, it can also be used by other platforms, including [Unix](https://techterms.com/definition/unix) and [Mac OS X](https://techterms.com/definition/os_x), using a software implementation called [Samba](https://techterms.com/definition/samba). By using Samba instructions, Mac, Windows, and Unix computers can share the same files, folders, and printers. This is great for those Windows-based office networks where there is a graphic designer who refuses to

## Samba

Samba is an open-source software implementation of the [SMB](https://techterms.com/definition/smb) networking protocol used by Windows computers. \(If you look closely, you can see the correlation between the two names.\) Samba allows other computer platforms, such as [Mac OS X](https://techterms.com/definition/os_x), Unix, Linux, IBM System 390, and OpenVMS to interact with Windows computers on the same network. This includes sharing files and using shared devices such as printers connected to other computers within the local network.

Because SMB was developed only for Windows, without Samba, other computer platforms would be isolated from Windows machines, even if they were part of the same network. Fortunately, Samba helps different types of computers work together as if they were all based on the same platform. This gives network administrators the freedom to choose multiple types of computers systems when setting up a network. Now that's a reason to dance!

### EternalBlue - MS17-010

EternalBlue exploits a vulnerability in Microsoft's implementation of the Server Message Block \(SMB\) protocol. This vulnerability is denoted by entry CVE-2017-0144\[9\]\[10\] in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures \(CVE\) catalog. The vulnerability exists because the SMB version 1 \(SMBv1\) server in various versions of Microsoft Windows mishandles specially crafted packets from remote attackers, allowing them to execute arbitrary code on the target computer.

On [Tuesday](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patch_Tuesday) , March 14, 2017, Microsoft issued security bulletin **MS17-010**, [\[13\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EternalBlue#cite_note-microsoft.com-13) which detailed the flaw and announced that [patches](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security_patch) had been released for all Windows versions that were currently supported at that time, these being [Windows 7](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_7) , [Windows 8.1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_8.1), [Windows 10](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_10), [Windows Server 2008](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Server_2008), [Windows Server 2012](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Server_2012), and [Windows Server 2016](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Server_2016), as well as [Windows Vista](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Vista) \(which had recently ended support\).
