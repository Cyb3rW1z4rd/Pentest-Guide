# Vim

see [Vim Tips](../../cheatsheets/vim-tips.md)

**\[count\] operation \[count\] motion = 2d3w = 2 times delete 3 words**

**z-enter shows current line on top** \(in vimrc define last seen lines\)

## Files

`vim +33 my_file.txt` to open file my\_file.txt with the cursor positioned on line 33

`:e /etc/passwd` or `:e tab tab` to open a file in your existing Vim session.

Vim comes with a built-in netrw plugin which is a great way to browse files and directories  
within a Vim session. I prefer `Nerdtree` as a plugin use `Ctrl-n`

`:Ex`- open current directory in current Vim window \(remember it as a shortcut of Explore\).

`:Vex` - open current directory in vertical split window.

`:r file.txt` Insert the file file.txt below the cursor in current buffer.

`:0r file.txt` Insert the file file.txt before the first line.

`:wq` Save currently opened file and exit Vim \(even if file is not changed\).

`:x` Exit Vim but write only when changes have been made.

`:w`Save currently opened file \(which was previously saved\).

`:w file.txt` Save currently opened file as file.txt.

## Moving around

`w` = word forward

`b` = word backwards

`tD` = goto till D

`Shift-g` = end of file

`gg` = begin of file

`Shift ^` = begin of line

`0` = \(zero\) start of line

`%`**Go to the matching pair of \(\), \[\], {}**

`:NUM` Go to line NUM. :28 jumps to line 28

```bash
Shift $ = end of line
```

```text
Shift $ = end of line
```

## Delete and replace

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="hjg" %}
```

```
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="jkhText" %}
```text

```
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

`dl` = delete letter or `r` = replace letter

`dw` = delete word `cw` = change word

`dd` = delete line cc= change line

`db` = delete word back

`x` = delete

`r`=replace, `a` = append on after current letter

`Shift-r` = replace mode

`d0`= delete to begin of line

`d$`= delete to end of line c$ = change till end of line

`.` = repeat last command

`dtw` **= delete till w**

`dTD`= delete backwards till D

**In insert mode** `ctrl-h` deletes back 1 character, `ctrl-w` deletes back 1 word, `ctrl-u`deletes line

You are in Insert mode typing. Press `Ctrl-o` and now you can run any Vim command . After running the command, you're automagically back to Insert mode

## Copy / Paste

`yy`= yank whole line \(copy\) or 4yy = yank 4 lines

`yw` = yank word or y2w = yank two words

`yl`= yank letter

`y0` = yank to begin of line

`p` = paste

`shift-P` = Paste after

`u` = undo

`ctrl –r` = redo

## **Substitute**

Replace = :%s/text to replace/replacement/i=ignore case g=global

`:%s/old/new/`= change old to new

`:%s/old/new/g` = globally replaced

`:5/s/old/new/`= replace on line 5

## **Objects**

`daw` = delete a word – boundary is a space

`das` = delete a sentence – boundary is a .

`dap`= delete a paragraph – boundary is white line

`ci` \( = change \(inside\] or ca\( = change with block identifier

`cit` = change inside tage like &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

`ci”` = change inside backupserver = “ deepfreeze1”

## Registers

`:reg` = registers. To paste from register use “number and then p for paste

`“a yy` = yank line in the a-register

`:reg a` = shows register a

`shift-i` and `shift-a` move the cursor to begin or end and of line start insert mode

`a` = move to next character and start insert mode

`o` and `shift-o` move next or before line

`Shift-j` is join two lines together

`g Shift-j` is join without extra space

`3 Shift-j` is join 3 lines together

`Shift-r` is replace mode and r is replace a single letter

## **Search**

`/`= search

`f b` = find letter b on same line

`Shift-f b` is find letter b backwards online

#### insearch enabled

`/a` then all a are highlighted

`n` = go to next highlighted

`?a` is backwards search for a

`*` = be on a word and the \* for next occurrence of word

`#` = backwards

## **visual mode**

`v` or `ctrl-c`

### **Macro**

`Q-a then q`= start macro in register q end end with g

`@a` = playback macro

`27,35 normal @d` = apply macro d on range of lines 27-35
