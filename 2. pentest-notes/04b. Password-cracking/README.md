# Password Cracking

### Easily hacked

* Default passwords like admin, password
* Numeric Passwords like 7392929
* Common Passwords like google, iloveyou
* Short Passwords Ajd, 739
* Same Passwords as used elsewhere

## Default Passwords

One of the biggest potential vulnerabilities is also one of the easiest to resolve: default passwords. Default passwords are set by the manufacturer when the device or system is built. They are documented and provided to the final consumer of the product and are intended to be changed. However, not all users or businesses get around to taking this step, and hence they leave themselves vulnerable. The reality is that with a bit of scanning and investigation, an attacking party can make some educated guesses about what equipment or systems you may be running. If they can determine that you have not changed the defaults, they can look up your default password at any of the following sites:
