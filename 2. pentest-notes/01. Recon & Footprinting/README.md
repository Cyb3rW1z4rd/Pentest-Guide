# Recon & Footprinting

Footprinting is the phase where we gathered information from various open source locations and through other techniques to learn about our target. We looked for information that told us about the organization such as technology, people, policies, facilities, networks, and other useful items. Footprinting helped create a profile that can be used for later stages of the attack as well as to plan countermeasures.

Information that was gathered during this phase included the following:

* IP address ranges
* Namespaces
* Employee information
* Phone numbers
* Facility information
* Job information

During this phase we found that a significant amount of data can be acquired from various sources both common and uncommon.

Penetration-Testing\(also known as Ethical Hacking\) must follow a methodical, organized, and controlled process in order to both effectively review targets and keep the penetration tester safe from consequences if issues arise.

While there are many steps associated with an engagement, none are more important than the act of information gathering or footprinting a designated target.

The detail with which one gathers information for the engagement will determine the effectiveness of the outcome for the entire penetration test.

Pentesters performing information gathering must not only be meticulous, but also must know and use different techniques in order to obtain information. Being this detail driven will allow the tester to record only the needed data on the intended target.

The Information gathering phase is focused on two essential aspects of all targets: **Business** and **Infrastructure**.

The Business side of information gathering deals with collecting information regarding the type of business, its stakeholders, assets, products, services, employees and generally non-technical information.

The organization will probably operate its business purpose through an Infrastructure such as networks, systems, domains, IP addresses and so on. The second phase of the Information Gathering process will focus on uncovering this type of information.

At the end of the Information Gathering process you should at least have the following important information about the target:

| Infrastructure | Business |
| :--- | :--- |
| Network Maps | Web presence \(domains\) |
| Network Blocks | Physical locations |
| IP addresses | Employees / Departments |
| Ports | Emails |
| Services | Partners and third parties |
| DNS | Press / news releases |
| Operating systems | Documents |
| Alive machines | Financial information |
| Systems | Job postings |

## Passive Information Gathering or OSINT

Passive information gathering is decidedly less aggressive and overt than active information gathering. Whereas active information gathering requires much more direct engagement with the target, passive does not. Passive uses methods that gather information indirectly about a target from other sources. These sources include websites, job postings, social media, and other types of sources. Typically the information-gathering process will start passively.

## Active Information Gathering

Active information gathering involves engagement with the target through techniques such as social engineering. Attackers tend to focus their efforts on the soft target, which tends to be human beings. A savvy attacker engages employees under different guises under various pretenses with the goal of socially engineering an individual to reveal information.
